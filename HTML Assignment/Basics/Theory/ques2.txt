-------STRUCTURE OF HTML---------
->A line containing HTML version information, a declarative header section
(delimited by the HEAD element), a body, which contains the document's actual 
content.
-> The <html> tags must begin and end the document and the <head> tags must 
appear before the <body> tags.
-> Also, the <title> tags must be within the <head> tags.
-> Four essential HTML tags form the basic structure for every HTML file:
<html></html>
<head></head>
<title></title>
<body></body>
---PURPOSES---
<head> : Contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as title, 
        styles, and scripts.
<title> : Sets the title of the HTML document, displayed in the browser's title 
        bar or tab.
<body> : Contains the content of the HTML document, including text, images, 
        links, and other elements.
