Ques:
What is the difference between block-level elements and inline elements in
HTML? Provide examples of each.

Ans:
-> Block elements are typically used to define larger blocks of content such as paragraphs, headings, and lists. Take up only as much width as necessary to display their content.
-> Inline elements are typically used to define small pieces of content such as text or images that are integrated into a larger block of text.
->  Block elements have top and bottom margins. Whereas Inline elements don't have a top and bottom margin. 
-> block-level Elements begin on new lines, whereas Inline Elements do not.

-> Example of an Inline Element :
A Div Tag or Paragraph Tag

-> Example of an Inline Element :
 An Anchor Tag or Link Tag
