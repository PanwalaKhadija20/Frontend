Ques: 
What is the difference between colspan and rowspan in tables? Provide
examples.

Ans:
-> The rowspan and colspan are the attributes of <td> tag.
-> These are used to specify the number of rows or columns a cell should merge. 
-> The rowspan attribute is for merging rows.
-> The colspan attribute is for merging columns of the table in HTML.
-> The colspan attribute is used to make a cell cover more than one main column.
-> In the same way, the rowspan attribute allows a cell to span rows and be 
situated in several rows at the same time.
-> ROWSPAN is used to combine the cells vertically. It merges the number of 
cells vertically and displays them as a single cell. COLSPAN is used to combine 
the cells horizontally.
