Ques: 
Why should tables be used sparingly for layout purposes? What is a better
alternative?

Ans:
-> The World Wide Web Consortium discourages use of tables for layout because 
they are striving for a web in which content and structure are completely 
separate from presentation.
-> Tables Are Not Accessible.

------The alternative Of Tables-----
        CSS Grid
-> CSS Grid is widely supported in all modern browsers, making it a reliable 
choice for web development. 
-> CSS Grid allows for complex layouts that were previously difficult to 
achieve with traditional layout methods.
