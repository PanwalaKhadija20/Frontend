Ques:
What is the purpose of the label element in a form, and how does it improve
accessibility?

Ans:
-> The <label> element also help users who have difficulty clicking on very 
small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes),because when the user 
clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the radio button or 
checkbox.
-> The <label> element is used to associate a text label with a form <input> 
field. 
-> For users who rely on screen readers, the label tag provides a clear 
description of each form control, making it easier to understand and interact 
with the form.
