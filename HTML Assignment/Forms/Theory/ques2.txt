Ques:
Explain the difference between the GET and POST methods in form submission.
When should each be used?

Ans:
-> There are two fundamental HTTP methods. 
-> GET is for fetching data, appending parameters in the URL, ideal for 
searches. 
-> POST, used for updates, sends data securely in the request body, perfect for
forms.
-> GET request is comparatively less secure because the data is exposed in the 
URL bar. POST request is comparatively more secure because the data is not 
exposed in the URL bar.
